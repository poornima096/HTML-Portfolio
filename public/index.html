<h1>The best anime according to Dhanush </h1>
<h2>Dhanush's top 3 anime of all time. </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p> His favourite characters are Eren and Mikasa.<br/>Those two characters ruled his whatsapp dp from past 4 years,<br/>he never thought of changing it<br/></p>
<h3>I want to eat your pancreas</h3>
<p>I don't know whether it's his top 3 anime,<br/>but he always says that this anime is one of the reason to enhance his bond with me..
   so obviously it should be his best anime..<br/></p>
   <h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>It's a guess i really don't know it's his top 3 or not,<br/>
    as i already mentioned the above three,please consider my efforts and make these three as your top 3 animee..</p>
